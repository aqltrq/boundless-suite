Working with GeoMesa data
=========================

GeoMesa is an open source project which provides an extension to GeoServer which allows it to interact with `Apache Accumulo <https://accumulo.apache.org/>`_ datastores. You can find out more about GeoMesa by visitng the LocationTech project `page <http://www.locationtech.org/projects/technology.geomesa>`_. 

Boundless Suite supports data saved in GeoMesa format.

Installing GeoMesa support
--------------------------

GeoMesa support isn't enabled by default, so it must be separately installed through an extension.

.. include:: ../include/ext_install_links.txt

Verifying installation
----------------------

.. include:: ../../install/include/ext/geomesa_verify.txt

For more information on adding a store and publishing layers, please see the `GeoMesa documentation <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/geoserver.html>`_.
